#+TITLE: DSP Assignment 3 IIR filtering Report

* Project Notes :NoExport:
** Project to-dos:
*** TODO Add real-time angle measurements to plot [0/2] :Ben:
- [X] write code to calc angle
- [X] integrate into real-time plot
- [X] write test
- [ ] Have Cameron Check angle code with working accelerometer
*** TODO Get latex pdf compilation working [2/3] :Ben:
- [X] instal tex package
- [X] setup ORG doc for export
- [-] Copy in source code
*** TODO add a filter unit test in the frequency domain
calculate the impulse response of the filter and use the fft to determine the frequency response
*** TODO Share/modify plotting code
- standard resolution
- a standard aspect ratio
** Submission
*** Submission Naming Convention
+ Allowed to include any other files in submission *aside from* data files (since code is supposed to run in real time)

*** Pre Submission checklist [/]
- [ ] final submission commit is made named "Final submission #n" where n is however long it takes us to get it right
- [ ] all team participants pull this commit and extract the contents of the final commit zip to a directory of thier choosing
- [ ] all team participants verify the [[*Submission  Naming Convention][Naming Convention]] of all files as well as the zip file itself
- [ ] all participants must run the IIR Unit tests
- [ ] If possible also run the real-time plotting code
- [ ] verify content of report PDF is satisfactory
** Report Question 1
*** TODO Discuss influence of filter cut-off freq [/]:Ben:NoExport:
- [ ] compare rise time of different filter designs
- [ ] discuss importance of rise time of the impulse response
*** TODO Create a data-flow diagram of the entire filter [/]:Ben:Peter:
- [ ] get tkiz working
- [ ] include final filter designs as tables referring to the symbolic variables defined in the data-flow diagram
*** TODO Alter the IIR DFD to just having symbolic coefficients :Peter:
** Report Question 2
** Report Question 3
** Report Question 4

** Ideas
*** IDEA use file links in submission dir
Rather than copying and pasting all of the required files into the submission directory use links.
Need to know:
- [ ] does compression works with
- [ ] how does git deal with such links
- [ ] how do other peoples computers deal with such links
