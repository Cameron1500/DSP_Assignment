#+TITLE: DSP Assignment 3 IIR filtering Report

* Project Notes :NoExport:
** Project to-dos:
*** TODO Add real-time angle measurements to plot [0/2] :Ben:
- [X] write code to calc angle
- [X] integrate into real-time plot
- [X] write test
- [ ] Have Cameron Check angle code with working accelerometer
*** TODO Get latex pdf compilation working [2/3] :Ben:
- [X] instal tex package
- [X] setup ORG doc for export
- [-] Copy in source code
*** TODO add a filter unit test in the frequency domain
calculate the impulse response of the filter and use the fft to determine the frequency response
*** TODO Share/modify plotting code
- standard resolution
- a standard aspect ratio
** Report Question 1
*** TODO Discuss influence of filter cut-off freq [/]:Ben:NoExport:
- [ ] compare rise time of different filter designs
- [ ] discuss importance of rise time of the impulse response
*** TODO Create a data-flow diagram of the entire filter [/]:Ben:Peter:
- [ ] get tkiz working
- [ ] include final filter designs as tables referring to the symbolic variables defined in the data-flow diagram
*** TODO Alter the IIR DFD to just having symbolic coefficients :Peter:
** Report Question 2
** Report Question 3
** Report Question 4
