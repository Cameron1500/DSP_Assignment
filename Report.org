#+TITLE: DSP Assignment 3 IIR filtering Report
#+INCLUDE: "~/.doom.d/orgReportHeader.org"
* Project Notes :NoExport:
** Project to-dos:
*** DONE Add real-time angle measurements to plot [4/4] :Ben:
- [X] write code to calc angle
- [X] integrate into real-time plot
- [X] write test
- [X] Have Cameron Check angle code with working accelerometer
*** DONE Get latex pdf compilation working [3/3] :Ben:
- [X] instal tex package
- [X] setup ORG doc for export
- [X] Copy in source code
*** DONE Share/modify plotting code
- standard resolution
- a standard aspect ratio
*** TODO write report
** Report TODOs:
*** WAIT Investigate the influence of filter cut-off freq [1/4] :Ben:NoExport:
- [X] compare rise time of different filter designs
- [-] do an FFT of the Prerecorded filter signal to determine the frequency of the sensor noise
- [-] do fft of a pre-recorded gesture to see what frequencies are present
- [-] discuss importance of rise time of the impulse response
*** DONE Create a data-flow diagram of the entire filter [1/1]:Ben:Peter:
- [X] include final filter designs as tables referring to the symbolic variables defined in the data-flow diagram
*** DONE Alter the IIR DFD to just having symbolic coefficients :Peter:

** Ideas
*** IDEA use file links in submission dir
Rather than copying and pasting all of the required files into the submission directory use links.
Need to know:
- [ ] does compression works with
- [ ] how does git deal with such links
- [ ] how do other peoples computers deal with such links
*** IDEA unit test in the frequency domain
- check the filter function and the filter design method in one foul swoop by interrogating the fft of a filter impulse response
*** IDEA do tilt sensor dataflow diagram using Tkiz

** Submission
*** Submission Naming Convention
+ Allowed to include any other files in submission *aside from* data files (since code is supposed to run in real time)
#+ATTR_LATEX: placement [H]

*** Pre-Submission checklist [/]
- [ ] final submission commit is made named "Final submission #n" where n is however long it takes us to get it right
- [ ] all team participants pull this commit and extract the contents of the final commit zip to a directory of thier choosing
- [ ] all team participants verify the [[*Submission  Naming Convention][Naming Convention]] of all files as well as the zip file itself
- [ ] all participants must run the IIR Unit tests
- [ ] If possible also run the real-time plotting code
- [ ] verify content of report PDF is satisfactory

* Introduction
:notes:
- [ ] Present the problem
- [ ] describe the working principles of an accelerometer Bases tilt sensor
:END:

* Working Principles
:notes:
- [ ] high level data flow diagrams
:END:
* Filter design
:notes:
- [ ] justify filter design requirements
- [ ] filter dataflow diagram + discuss
- [ ] discuss/ justify filter design methods
  + butter-worth filter Scipy. Include code?
  + second order
  + No cascading required? - we don't need steep cutoff
  + also we want the code to execute as fast as possible (IIR Ideal for this application)
- [ ] discuss importance of rise time as a metric for "responsiveness"
- [ ] figure of harmonic content
- [ ] figure of impulse response
:END:
** Sensor noise

* Implementation
:notes:
- [ ] discuss how sample rate was checked
- [ ] discuss unit testing
  + include here the tables of filter coefficients used (refer to dataflow diagram)
